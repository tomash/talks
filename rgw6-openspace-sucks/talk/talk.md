Based on an analysis of 10,000 programming sessions recorded from 86 programmers using Eclipse and Visual Studio, and a survey of 414 programmers, we found:

* A programmer takes 10-15 minutes to start editing code after resuming work from an interruption.
* When interrupted during an edit of a method, a programmer resumed work in less than a minute only 10 percent of the time.
* A programmer is likely to get just one uninterrupted two-hour session in a day.

Visual noise, the activity or movement around the edges of an employee’s field of vision, can erode concentration and disrupt analytical thinking or creativity, research shows. While employers have long tried to quiet disruptive sounds in open workspaces, some are now combating visual noise too. The answer could be as low-tech as strategically placed plants or more drab wall colors.

In an experiment with Chinese factory workers published in 2012, Ethan Bernstein, an assistant professor of leadership and organizational behavior at Harvard Business School, found teams were 10% to 15% more productive when they worked behind a curtain that shielded them from supervisors’ view. The employees felt freer to experiment with new ways to solve problems and improve efficiency when protected from their bosses’ critical gaze, Dr. Bernstein says.

In the Canada Life survey, those employees surveyed who worked in open-plan offices took over 70% more sick days than those who worked from home.

While employees who work from home only took an average of 1.8 sick days last year, workers in open plan offices took 3.1 days.
