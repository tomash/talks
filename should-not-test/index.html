<section><h1>When you should not write tests</h1>
<h3>Tomasz Stachewicz</h3>
<p>@_tomash</p>
</section><section name="1">
<h3>Why do we write tests?</h3>
</section><section name="2">
<h3>Bad tests are worse than no tests.</h3>
</section><section name="3">
<p>They give a false sense of security,</p>
<p>while lack of tests is a screaming call-to-action.</p>
</section><section name="4">
<p>Instead of preventing regressions,<br>
bad tests will make regressions creep up in qa/production<br>
even more often than untested code.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;We have tests for it so we don&rsquo;t need to click.&rdquo;)</p>
</section><section name="5">
<h2>Bad Reasons:</h2>
<p>(in order of importance)</p>
</section><section name="6">
<h3>1. You don&rsquo;t know how given code should work.</h3>
</section><section name="7">
<p>Popular &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t know how to implement it, write test cases for it&rdquo; meme.</p>
</section><section name="8">
<p>Result: ugly, bad-written code which needs refactoring before it was even created, with lots of tests for edge cases coming from bad, un-considered code in the first place.</p>
</section><section name="9">
<h3>Solution: think.</h3>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have an idea, think more: read, talk to people, go for a walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First solve the problem, then write the code.&rdquo;</p>
</section><section name="10">
<h3>2. You don&rsquo;t know when this test would fail.</h3>
</section><section name="11">
<p>Remember the purpose of tests?</p>
</section><section name="12">
<p>Purpose is defeated if test won&rsquo;t fail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fails only if method is removed&rdquo; is not a good reason to keep the test.</p>
</section><section name="13">
<h3>Solution: think.</h3>
<p>If a test can&rsquo;t fail in reasonable scenarios, don&rsquo;t write it.</p>
</section><section name="14">
<h3>3. Testing what&rsquo;s already tested (in the library or framework).</h3>
</section><section name="15">
<p>Frequent offender: application tests for simple <code>validates</code> calls.</p>
</section><section name="16">
<h3>Solution: see 2.</h3>
<p>don&rsquo;t write test that won&rsquo;t fail.</p>
</section><section name="17">
<h3>4. You understand the code but have hard time writing tests for it.</h3>
</section><section name="18">
<p>Except for environment setup difficulties, complicated tests are a symptom of complicated code.</p>
<p>See: Object Orgy &ndash; an antipattern (violation of Law of Demeter).</p>
</section><section name="19">
<h3>Solution: write an acceptance test</h3>
<p>&hellip;covering this class from a high level and refactor the hell out of it.</p>
</section><section name="20">
<h3>5. Test is copypasted.</h3>
</section><section name="21">
<p>Don&rsquo;t. Just don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Duplication indicates shitty, repeated code or shitty, repeated tests. Often both.</p>
</section><section name="22">
<h3>Ending remarks.</h3>
<p>Tests are still code: they are a cost to develop and cost to maintain.</p>
<p>Make them worth the cost.</p>
</section><section name="23">
<h3>That&rsquo;s all, folks!</h3>
<p>What are the bad reasons you know?</p>
